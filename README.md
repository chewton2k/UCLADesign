# UCLA Room Design Project

by Tommy Yu, Owen Fan, Alex Tamanaha, Charlton Shih, Fiona Zhang.

Our project focuses on developing a tool that allows users to design and customize their room layout to align with their preferences and style. Transitioning into a new dorm room presents challenges, particularly for freshmen or individuals unfamiliar with their new environment. Properly planning a room layout and understanding the necessary items can significantly ease this transition.

The tool provides an interactive web app where users can visualize their room setup by rearranging furniture and decorations virtually. In addition to aiding with spatial planning, the tool generates a checklist of recommended items tailored to the specific layout and room dimensions. This functionality reduces the anxiety associated with moving into a new space, enabling users to prepare better and optimize their environment. By integrating these features, the project seeks to enhance the overall moving experience, ensuring it is both efficient and personalized.
